# Supply-Chain-Risk-Classification-and-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting delivery time deviations using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, Bayesian inference, and time-series forecasting. The goal is to identify key factors affecting delivery delays, assess risk classification, and develop predictive models to improve logistics efficiency.

The model focuses on :
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key metrics like delivery delays, fuel consumption, and congestion levels.
2. Identify patterns and anomalies using statistical tests and Bayesian analysis.
3. Develop time-series forecasting models (SARIMAX, ARIMA) to predict future deviations in delivery time.
4. Classify risk levels based on congestion, probability of delay, and other influencing factors.
