# 🚚 Supply Chain Risk Classification and Prediction  

This project focuses on **analyzing and predicting delivery time deviations** in supply chain logistics using **EDA, statistical testing, Bayesian inference, and time-series forecasting**.  
The aim is to **identify key risk factors, classify risks, and build predictive models** that help improve delivery efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Efficient supply chain management is critical for reducing delays, fuel costs, and congestion risks.  
This project provides:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand delivery trends, delays, and anomalies.  
- **Statistical & Bayesian Analysis:** Identify hidden patterns and quantify uncertainty.  
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Predict future delivery deviations using models like **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX**.  
- **Risk Classification:** Categorize risk levels based on congestion, probability of delay, and other influencing factors.
